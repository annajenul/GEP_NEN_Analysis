# Analysis of High-Grade Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms Dataset: Feature Selection using RENT and UBayFS
## Overview

This repository is intended to provide supplementary material for the experiments conducted in the following research article preprint:

<a href = "https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2302.10106">A. Jenul, H. L. Stokmo, S. Schrunner, M.-E. Revheim, G. O. Hjortland, and O. Tomic (2023): Towards Understanding the Survival of Patients with High-Grade Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: An Investigation of Ensemble Feature Selection in the Prediction of Overall Survival, arXiv.org:2302.10106</a>

## Structure

Experiments have been conducted in R (UBayFS) and Python (RENT), evaluations have been made in R only. Code to reproduce the selected features can be found in the directories RENT and UBayFS, respectively. Resulting feature sets are stored in Rdata-files, which is used for evaluating the predictive performance, stability, etc.
